## Requirements

- Julia (v1.12.5 is recommended, but newer versions may also work)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code interactively)

## Installation

1. Install Julia: https://julialang.org/downloads/;
2. Install Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install;
3. Initialize the Julia environment:
    This archive contains the Julia environment configuration file [`Project.toml`](Project.toml).
    To set up the environment, navigate to this directory in your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    julia --project=/path/to/Project.toml -e "using Pkg; Pkg.resolve()"
    ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html;
5. Run the Jupyter notebooks `main-*.ipynb` to reproduce the results in the paper.

## Description

- [`main-benchmark.ipynb`](main-benchmark.ipynb): This notebook contains the code to reproduce the benchmark results.
- [`main-data.ipynb`](main-data.ipynb): This notebook contains the code to reproduce the data analysis results.
    This notebook will take a long time to run, and it will generate a large amount of data.
    The data generated by this notebook is also available in the [`data/out/`](data/out/) directory, so you can skip this notebook if you want to save time.
- [`main-plot.ipynb`](main-plot.ipynb): This notebook contains the code to reproduce some plots in the paper.
